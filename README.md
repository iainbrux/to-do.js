Hello! This is my project to showcase my CRUD capabilities (no pun!) and to staple my understanding of:
- DOM Manipulation
- Webpack
- HTML, CSS & JS
- Local Storage

Project status /-- IN PROGRESS --/

Features I will aim to add:
- Add firebase / mongoDB support
- Add local storage support (DONE! 29/01/2021)
- Configure JS for dom
- General styling improvements

Current known bugs:

- Takes two clicks on either edit or delete button from user created tasks to fire event
